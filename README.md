A one-day project completed at the [2016 Stupid Shit No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com/), Fireplace is a a virtual reality experience where the player can immerse themselves with a TV playing a video of a fireplace. The project is a critique on modern day Fireplace DVD/channelâ€™s uselessness by instantiating this lack of functionality into virtual reality. Fireplace received media attention from [MOTHERBOARD](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/inside-the-stupid-shit-no-one-needs-terrible-ideas-hackathon?utm_source=mbfb) and [Technical.ly](http://technical.ly/brooklyn/2016/02/08/stupid-shit-no-one-needs-and-terrible-ideas-hackathon-projects/).
